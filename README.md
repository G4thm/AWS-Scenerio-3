## AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing System

Develop a cloud-based AI solution for dynamic pricing. Integrate modules into a unified system, build a data lake, deploy AI with the data pipeline, and ensure system security. Present CI/CD deployment, analytics insights, performance metrics, visualizations, and risk mitigation report.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete solution
PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py

# Run the interactive demonstration
python demo.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```
